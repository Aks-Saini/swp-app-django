## Project Overview
The Smart Walmart Packager is a cutting-edge solution designed to optimize trailer loading by maximizing package capacity, balancing axle weights, and ensuring a seamless loading experience. This innovative approach aims to significantly increase the efficiency of logistics operations.

### Captured Information
The following truck details are captured when it enters the warehouse:

* Model name
* Length
* Breadth
* Height
* Tare weight
* Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)
* Axle weight ratings
* Axle group weight ratings
* Wheel load capacity
* Destination

### Solution Overview
The application leverages this information to identify relevant packages based on their destination and delivery dates. It then creates an optimized loading design, allocating packages to the trailer and providing real-time visibility into package placement. This proactive approach enables forecasting and planning, allowing logistics teams to stay one step ahead of shipments. By increasing product visibility, the Smart Walmart Packager revolutionizes the logistics industry, providing unparalleled insights into package movement and location. 


## Features

### 3D Visualization
The Visualizer is a standalone microservice running on a separate server, designed to:

* Create 3D packing designs and visualizations of packages
* Increase packing efficiency and product visibility by identifying package locations within the truck
* Facilitate unloading by knowing the exact location of each package

### Package Allocation
